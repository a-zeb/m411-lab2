REFLECTION

How did array methods like push() and filter() help you manipulate data in this activity?
They helped me to implement the add and search functionality.

What challenges did you face when trying to filter and search for items in the array?
Getting the syntax correct.

How would you modify this code to make it more efficient or user-friendly?
I would style it with bootstrap.
